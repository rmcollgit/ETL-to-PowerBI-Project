# PowerBI-Project
This repository contains a complete end-to-end data project that transforms raw sales data into a clean, insightful Power BI dashboard. The dataset is sourced from Kaggleâ€™s Superstore dataset, which includes detailed information on customer orders, products, delivery times, and geographical locations across the United States.

The project follows a clear pipeline: data is extracted, cleaned using Python and Pandas, exported to CSV, and then visualised using Power BI. It is designed to be fully reproducible on your local machine.

## The dataset

Customer information: name, region, and ID

Product data: category, sub-category, and product names

Sales performance: sales value (count of sales was calculated to infer sales volume)

Delivery details: order and ship dates and ship mode (delivery time was calculated)

Geography: US cities, states, and postal codes


## How to run on your machine

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the files in the Python folder, in the order; get_data.py, create_df.py, cleaning_data.py
3. Open the dashboard in the PowerBI folder
4. Ensure that the dashboard has access to the CSV from python then transform, close and apply.

## Interacting with the dashboard

Location slicer:
- On the side of each page there is a dropdown list of US states, just select the ones that you are interested in to filter all visuals.
- To reset press select/deselect all.

Year slicer:
- On the side of each page you can slide across years or manually enter a year to filter all visuals.

Other filters:
